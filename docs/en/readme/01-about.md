# About

**This document may be outdated.**

This is the main template repository for our projects and the origin of every other template, which is why it shouldn't be used directly for end products. It includes the basic structure and important, so-called dotfiles.

*At the moment it includes more specific files (a rollup configuration for example), but those will be removed once we reach 2.0.0 and have a separate repository for them.*

"Unordered" lists in this document are ordered by priority from top to bottom, but aren't markdown ordered lists because they don't signify fixed sequences of steps.

This document uses emoji suffixes in some cases to possibly speed up your setup process by highlighting options you may or may not want to take into consideration:

- The suffix 💎 marks a **recommended** option or extra-step.
- The suffix 🤡 marks a possible but **not recommended** option.
- The suffixes 🍎 (macOS), 🪟 (Windows and [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)) and 🐧 (Linux) mark information or installation steps unique to **specific platforms**.
